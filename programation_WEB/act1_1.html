    <B>Lorem Ipsum</B>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s</mark>, when an unknown
printer took a <I>galley of type</I> and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
centuries, but also the leap into <U>electronic typesetting</U>, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
the <I>1960s</I> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
